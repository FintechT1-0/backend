# Server Setup and Launch Instructions

## Overview
This repository contains a server application built with **FastAPI**.  
Follow the steps below to set up and run the server locally.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **git** (optional, if cloning from a repository)

---

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Download the Repository
Clone the repository using Git or download it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FintechT1-0/backend.git
````

Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the repository directory and install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Launch the Server

In the command prompt (CMD), navigate to the folder containing the repository:

```bash
cd path\to\repository
```

Then start the server using **Uvicorn**:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app
```

The server should now be running locally, typically accessible at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated and available at the following endpoint once the server is running:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and example usage.

---

## Troubleshooting

* If dependencies fail to install, ensure you have the correct version of Python and pip.
* If the port `8000` is already in use, you can specify another port when launching the server:

  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080
  ```
